          <p>current generation W205 C-Class was launched at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. It is the first car to use the all-new Modular Rear Architecture (MRA) platform, which it shares with the contemporary Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class models. The new structure is significantly lighter using aluminium and high strength steel extensively throughout the body, resulting in a 100-kilogram (220 lb) weight decrease.[10]

The car was officially unveiled on 16 December 2013.[11] W205 production commenced on 4 February 2014 at the Bremen plant.[12] Production is also undertaken at Mercedes-Benz plants in East London (South Africa), Iracem√°polis (Brazil) and Tuscaloosa, Alabama (United States). European sales began in March 2014, while the vehicle went on sale in North America in September 2014.

The Mercedes-Benz C-Class 205 chassis spawned four C-Class bodystyles; Sedan (W205), Wagon (S205), Coupe (C205), and Cabriolet (A205).

The W205 Mercedes-Benz C-Class received a new look, which made its debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, including exterior changes and new engines.</p>
