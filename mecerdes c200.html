          <p>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Daimler AG. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in Sindelfingen and Bremen, Germany as well as numerous satellite factories in other countries. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was produced on 1 June 1993 and the first second generation (W203) rolled off the assembly line on 18 July 2000. The C-Class has been available with a 4MATIC (i.e., four-wheel drive) option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the latest generation C-Class (W205) came out in 2014.

Though initially available as a sedan and a station wagon, the W203 series in 2000 debuted a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) version that, when face-lifted, became the Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. The CLC-Class remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.</p>
