          <h1>audi s6</h1>
          <p>Packaged in a soberly styled four-door body, the 2021 Audi S6 is a stealthy sport sedan that won't be immediately noticed for its performance potential. Based on the A6 luxury sedan, the S6 heats things up with a 444-hp twin-turbocharged V-6, a performance-tuned suspension, and standard all-wheel drive. It will keep up with the rivals such as the BMW M550i and the Mercedes-AMG E53 on a twisty road and also looks quite handsome pulling up to the valet stand on date night. Inside, the S6 offers the same space and features as the A6, so passengers will find plenty of space and amenities to make them comfy on long trips. Not slick looking enough for you? Audi also offers the mechanically similar S7, which features a racier fastback rooflineâ€”and the bonkers RS6 Avant station wagon, which is pumped up with even more power to go along with its increased utility.</p>
